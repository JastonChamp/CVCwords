# Word Spinner

Word Spinner is a small browser-based phonics game. The page spins through a variety of letter combinations and prompts players to blend the resulting sounds into words. It is designed for quick practice with common consonant-vowel patterns.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No extra build step or server is required, but using a local HTTP server (e.g. with `python -m http.server`) avoids potential browser restrictions on audio playback.
3. Make sure your browser can play audio, as the game uses `.mp3` files for letter sounds and effects.

## Prerequisites

- A modern browser with JavaScript enabled.
- Speakers or headphones to hear the sound assets.


## Audio Assets

The repository contains numerous .mp3 files used for letter pronunciations and sound effects during gameplay.
